# Numena

A clean and optimized numerical computing library written in Rust.  

Numena is not just another Rust library for Rust developers. Scientific computing is often messy, 
and Python has dominated because it is simple and approachable.  Numena shows that Rust can provide 
the same ease of use while adding safety, performance, and reliability.

A library in Rust, but not *just* for Rustaceans. 

Still in development.
